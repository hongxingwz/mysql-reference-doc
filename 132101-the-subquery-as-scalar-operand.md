# 13.2.10.1 The Subquery as Scalar Operand

In its simplest form, a subquery is a scalar subquery that returns a single value. A scalar subquery is a simple operand, and you can use it almost anywhere a single column value or literal is legal, and you can expect it to have those characteristic that all operands have: a data type, a length, an indication that it can be NULL, and so on. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE t1(s1 INT, s2 CHAR(5) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(100, 'abcde');
SELECT (SELECT s2 FROM t1);
```

The subquery in this **SELECT **returns a single value \('abcde'\) that has a data type of **CHAR**, a length of 5,  a character set and collation equal to the defaults in effect at **CREATE TABLE** time, and an indication that  value in the column can be **NULL**,  **Nullability** of the value selected by a scalar subquery is not copied because if the subquery result is empty, the result is NULL. For the subquery just shown, if **t1 **were empty, the result would be NULL even though s2 is NOT NULL.

There are a few contexts in which a scalar subquery cannot be used. If a statement permits only a literal value,  you cannot use a subquery. For example, LIMIT requires literal integer arguments, and LOAD DATA INFILE requires a literal string file name. You cannot use subqueries to supply these values.

When you see examples in the following sections that contain the rather spartan construct `(SELECT column1 FROM t1)`, imagine that your own code contains much more diverse and complex constructions.

Suppose that we make two tables:


```
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
CREATE TABLE t2 (s1 INT);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2);
```
Then perform a **SELECT**:


```
SELECT (SELECT s1 FROM t2) FROM t1;
```

The result is 2 because there is a row in **t2** containing a column **s1** that has a value of **2**

A scalar subquery can be part of an expression, but remember the parentheses, even if the subquery is an operand that provides an argument for a function. For example:


```
SELECT UPPER((SELECT s1 FROM t1)) FROM t2;
```

# 13.6.5.7 RETURN Syntax

![](/assets/1504957660414.png)The **RETURN **statement terminates execution of a stored function and returns the value _**expr **_to the function caller. There must be at least one **RETURN** statement in a stored function. There may be more than one if the function has multiple exit points.

This statement is not used in stored procedures, triggers, or events. The **LEAVE** statement can be used to exit a stored program of those types.

# 23.1 Defining Stored Programs

Each stored program contains a body that consists of an SQL statement. This statement may be a compound statement made up of several statements separated by semicolon\(**;**\) characters. For example, the following stored procedure has a body made up of a **BEGIN ... END** block that contains a **SET **statement and a **REPEAT** loop that itself contains another **SET** statement:

```
delimiter $$
CREATE PROCEDURE DOREPEAT(p1 INT)
BEGIN
	SET @x = 0;
	REPEAT SET @x = @x + 1; UNTIL  @x > p1 END REPEAT;
	SELECT  @x from test0907.events_list limit 1;
END$$

delimiter ;
```

If you use the **mysql **client program to define a stored program containing semicolon characters, a problem arises. By default, **mysql **itself recognizes the semicolon as a statement delimiter, so you must redefine the delimiter temporarily to cause **mysql** to pass the entire stored program definition to the server.

to redefine the **mysql** delimiter, use the **delimiter** command, The following example shows how to do this for the **dorepeat\(\)** procedure just shown. The delimiter is changed to **// **to enable the entire  definition to be passed to the server as a single statement, and then restored to **; **before invoking the procedure. This enables the **; **delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed through to the server rather than being interpreted by **mysql** itself;** **

```sql
mysql> delimiter //
mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE DOREPEAT(p1 INT)
    -> BEGIN
    -> SET @x = 0;
    -> REPEAT SET @x = @x + 1; UNTIL  @x > p1 END REPEAT;
    -> END//
ERROR 1304 (42000): PROCEDURE DOREPEAT already exists
mysql> 
mysql> delimiter ;
mysql> call DOREPEAT(1000);
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
| 1001 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> 
mysql> SELECT  @x;
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
| 1001 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can redefine the delimiter to a string other than **//**, and the delimiter can consist of a single character or multiple characters. You should avoid the use of the backslash\(**\**\) character because that is the escape character for MySQL.

The following is an example of a function that takes a parameter, performs an operation using an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is unnecessary to use **delimiter ** because the function definition contains no internal **; **statement delimiters: 

```sql
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))
    -> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC
    -> RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ', s, '!');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT hello('world');
+----------------+
| hello('world') |
+----------------+
| Hello, world!  |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

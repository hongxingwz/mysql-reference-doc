# 1.8.2.2 UPDATE Differences
If you access a column from the table to be updated in an expression, **UPDATE** uses the current value of the column. The second assignment in the following statement sets **col2** to the current(updated)**col1** and **col2** have the same value. This behavior differs from standard SQL.


```
UPDATE t1 SET col1 = col1 + 1, col2 = col1;
```
